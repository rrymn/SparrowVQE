# SparrowVQE: Visual Question Explanation for Course Content Understanding

A Custom 3B parameter Model Enhanced for Educational Contexts: This specialized model integrates slide-text pairs from machine learning classes, leveraging a unique training approach. It connects a frozen pre-trained vision encoder (SigLip) with a frozen language model (Phi-2) through an innovative projector. The model employs attention mechanisms and language modeling loss to deeply understand and generate educational content, specifically tailored to the context of machine learning education.

## How to use


**Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install transformers 
pip install -q pillow accelerate einops
```


```Python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from PIL import Image

torch.set_default_device("cuda")

#Create model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "rrymn/SparrowVQE", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("rrymn/SparrowVQE", trust_remote_code=True)

#function to generate the answer
def predict(question, image_path):
    #Set inputs
    text = f"A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: <image>\n{question}? ASSISTANT:"
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    
    input_ids = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt').input_ids.to('cuda')
    image_tensor = model.image_preprocess(image)
    
    #Generate the answer
    output_ids = model.generate(
        input_ids,
        max_new_tokens=25,
        images=image_tensor,
        use_cache=True)[0]
    
    return tokenizer.decode(output_ids[input_ids.shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip()
